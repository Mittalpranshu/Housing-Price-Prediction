# üè° Housing Price Prediction

This project is a **machine learning pipeline** for predicting housing prices using the **California Housing dataset**.  
It demonstrates an **end-to-end ML workflow**: loading data, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## üßæ Dataset Description

The dataset (`housing.csv`) contains information about housing districts in California, including:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `median_income` | Median income of the district |
| `total_rooms` | Total number of rooms |
| `total_bedrooms` | Total number of bedrooms |
| `population` | Total population of the district |
| `households` | Number of households |
| `ocean_proximity` | Categorical feature indicating distance from ocean |
| `median_house_value` | Target variable (house price) |

The dataset is split into **train** and **test** sets using **stratified sampling** based on income categories to ensure balanced distribution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Preprocessing

### Numerical Features
- Missing values are replaced with the **median** of the column.  
- Features are scaled using **StandardScaler** for normalization.  

### Categorical Features
- `ocean_proximity` is **one-hot encoded**.  
- Unknown categories during inference are ignored automatically.

### Pipeline
- Uses `ColumnTransformer` to combine numerical and categorical preprocessing.  
- Saved as `pipeline.pkl` for reuse during inference.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Dataset
The script reads `housing.csv` and prepares features and target.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Stratified Train-Test Split
- `median_income` is binned into 5 categories (`income_cat`) for stratification.  
- `StratifiedShuffleSplit` ensures that the test set has a similar income distribution as the training set.  
- Test data is saved as `input.csv`.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build Preprocessing Pipeline
- Numerical pipeline: median imputation + standard scaling  
- Categorical pipeline: one-hot encoding  
- Combined using `ColumnTransformer` and saved as `pipeline.pkl`  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Train Model
- Model: **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Training features are passed through the preprocessing pipeline  
- Model is trained on training data and saved as `model.pkl`  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Inference
- If `model.pkl` and `pipeline.pkl` exist:
  1. Load pipeline and model  
  2. Transform `input.csv` using the pipeline  
  3. Predict housing prices  
  4. Save predictions to `output.csv`
